# config-files

Hey! This is where I keep all my config files for BASH and Vim and VSCode and git and and and ...

To set up, run `./setup.bash`. This will move all your existing dot files into an archive and move all these config files to your home directory. There's also an option to dry-run and a revert option in a timeout before the initial run finishes. 

Do check out the setup.bash! I do take some pride in it ;)
